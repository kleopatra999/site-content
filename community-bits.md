So, where does our little Cayley community live?  The main place is our 
discourse forum (which can almost be used like a mailing list).

- https://discourse.cayley.io/

We also exist on IRC, come say hi!  Don't know anything about IRC, here is a [Getting Started Guide](http://richard.esplins.org/siwi/2011/07/08/getting-started-freenode-irc/).

- [#cayley on freenode](irc://irc.freenode.net/cayley).  

Of course, we also have a community Github repository.

There are other various pockets of Cayley communities, but right now because we are a small open source project we really want to focus our efforts on the three listed above.
